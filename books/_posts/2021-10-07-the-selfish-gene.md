description: "As influential today as when it was first published, The Selfish Gene has become a classic exposition of evolutionary thought. Professor Dawkins articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication. This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published."

"The million copy international bestseller, critically acclaimed and translated into over 25 languages.

As influential today as when it was first published, The Selfish Gene has become a classic exposition of evolutionary thought. Professor Dawkins articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication. This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published.

This 40th anniversary edition includes a new epilogue from the author discussing the continuing relevance of these ideas in evolutionary biology today, as well as the original prefaces and foreword, and extracts from early reviews.

Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think."

### My Comment
* * *
Richard Dawkins is a prominent scientist and biologist, I've read several books of his, this one is probably one of his best and most well known books.

Even though I had read multiple books of his before this one, including "The Blind Watchmaker", "God Delusion"... and some other Evolution books like "The Red Queen", I was having many aha moments during reading this book and it simply changed the way I look at nature and life as a whole and changed my perspective on the whole world as a human being.

It is definitely one of the best scientific books of all times.

Highly Recommended if you are a critical thinker and have an open mind for new ideas.

Read [Virus of the Mind](/books/2021/virus-of-the-mind-the-new-science-of-the-meme) after this book, it's an expansion of Richard Dawkins' theory of memetics which he discusses on chapter 11 of this book. Very interesting theory that explains many things about human culture and human mind bugs and thinking flaws that exist today.
