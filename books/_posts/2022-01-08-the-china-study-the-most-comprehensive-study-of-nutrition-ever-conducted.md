## Amazon[^1] Description
* * *
Even today, as trendy diets and a weight-loss frenzy sweep the nation, two-thirds of adults are still obese and children are being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, typically an “adult” disease, at an alarming rate. If we’re obsessed with being thin more so than ever before, why are Americans stricken with heart disease as much as we were 30 years ago?

In The China Study, Dr. T. Colin Campbell details the connection between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The report also examines the source of nutritional confusion produced by powerful lobbies, government entities, and opportunistic scientists. The New York Times has recognized the study as the “Grand Prix of epidemiology” and the “most comprehensive large study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease.”

The China Study is not a diet book. Dr. Campbell cuts through the haze of misinformation and delivers an insightful message to anyone living with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and those concerned with the effects of aging.

## My Comment
* * *
This book is about one of the longest and most comprehensive researches ever done in the history of nutrition field. This study took about 27 years and the results were startling. It concluded that animal meat and diary products may boost the growth of cancer cells and a chain of other diseases and also vegetarianism is the real diet for us. This was the summary of this book but it contains many other essential details. Whether you believe the results of this experiment are right or wrong, there is no doubt that fruits and vegetables are absolutely necessary for our diet in order for us to maintain a healthy lifestyle and many explanations in this book make it really clear why this is so.
I had read this book many years ago when I'd put a lot of effort into bodybuilding and healthy diets and the explanations in this book was really eye opening for me at that time. As I searched amazon for this book post, I saw that there is now a revised edition of this book[^4] that's been written in recent years, I recommend that you read the new revised and expanded edition.
