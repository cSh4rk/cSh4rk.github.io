## Amazon[^1] Description
* * *
**Bug Bounty Bootcamp teaches you how to hack web applications. You will learn how to perform reconnaissance on a target, how to identify vulnerabilities, and how to exploit them. You'll also learn how to navigate bug bounty programs set up by companies to reward security professionals for finding bugs in their web applications.**

Bug bounty programs are company-sponsored programs that invite researchers to search for vulnerabilities on their applications and reward them for their findings. This book is designed to help beginners with little to no security experience learn web hacking, find bugs, and stay competitive in this booming and lucrative industry.

You'll start by learning how to choose a program, write quality bug reports, and maintain professional relationships in the industry. Then you'll learn how to set up a web hacking lab and use a proxy to capture traffic. In Part 3 of the book, you'll explore the mechanisms of common web vulnerabilities, like XSS, SQL injection, and template injection, and receive detailed advice on how to find them and bypass common protections. You'll also learn how to chain multiple bugs to maximize the impact of your vulnerabilities.

Finally, the book touches on advanced techniques rarely covered in introductory hacking books but that are crucial to understand to hack web applications. You'll learn how to hack mobile apps, review an application's source code for security issues, find vulnerabilities in APIs, and automate your hacking process. By the end of the book, you'll have learned the tools and techniques necessary to be a competent web hacker and find bugs on a bug bounty program.

You can take as many ethical hacking courses as you want, but when it comes to bug bounty, there is so much information and tools it can be imitating to start . . . This really should be the first book read by ANYONE looking to start in the bug bounty game."
