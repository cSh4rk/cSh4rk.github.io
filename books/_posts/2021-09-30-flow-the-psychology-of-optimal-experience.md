## My Comment
* * *
This book describes a human conscious state known as Flow. In this state, we feel most joyful, creative, focused, tireless and almost invincible.

Most people have experienced this state some times in their life but can't pinpoint exactly what it was or how to repeat and experience it again.

This book is all about Flow, how to create and sustain it so we can have more joyful and meaningful moments in our life and work.
