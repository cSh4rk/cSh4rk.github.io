These are some Ruby examples equivalents of my previous post[^2](about gadget chains in PHP), that show the process of finding gadget chains in Ruby programming language; also as mentioned in one of these articles, there may still be some undiscovered gadget chains for cybersecurity researchers to find.

Also there is a Web Security Academy lab to practice these types of documented gadget chains.[^3]
