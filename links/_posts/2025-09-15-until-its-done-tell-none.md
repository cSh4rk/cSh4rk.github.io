My first post after a long time, although it seems like a purely fun post, it's got a powerful psychological message: 

***Don't talk about your goals and what you're doing unless they're already done.***

You lose the motivation and mental energy necessary to achieve your goals if you talk about them prematurely. There are already some credible researches done about this subject.

It comes from research in social psychology:

When you talk about a goal, your brain gets a premature reward signal. People praise you, or you feel proud just by saying it. That dopamine hit tricks your mind into thinking you’ve already made progress.

As a result, motivation drops, because the urge to prove yourself through action is partially satisfied by words alone.

This is why many successful people keep their plans quiet until they’re done — it protects their mental energy.

Also there are other reasons for not talking about your goals but this one is the most important.
