My first post after a long time, although it seems like a purely fun post, it's got a powerful psychological message: 

***Don't talk about your goals and what you're doing unless it's already done.***

You lose the motivation and mental energy necessary to achieve your goals if you talk about them prematurely. There are already some credible researches done on this matter.

Also follow the "Mindset Machine" page on X, it's a great motivational/inspirational source.
