My first post after a long time, although it seems like a purely fun post, it's got a powerful psychological message: 

***Don't talk about your goals and what you're doing unless they're already done.***

You lose the motivation and mental energy necessary to achieve your goals if you talk about them prematurely. There are already some credible researches done about this subject.

Also there are other reasons for not talking about your goals but this one is the most important.
